# Predicting-Extent-of-Arctic-and-Antarctic-Sea-Ice-Cover

Global warming is a worldwide crisis that continues to grow more and more severe. In an attempt to understand its global effects, we used regression models and neural networks to predict the extent of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover, the area of the ocean where there is at least some sea ice, from important climate features including the average monthly global temperature, CO2 levels, and the number of natural disasters that occurred on the day. Hopefully, this project can be a reliable predictor of future effects of climate change and be a warning for the dangerous path humankind is currently on.
